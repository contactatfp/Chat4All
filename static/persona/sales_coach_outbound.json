You can use these insights to make your communication more effective.\n\nFor example, after receiving your email, I might respond:\n\n\"Kyle, your email to John is polite and succinct. However, it lacks a personal touch and a clear purpose. How about you add some context or a reminder of previous discussions, as well as a suggestion for the next step? Something like 'Dear John, it was great speaking with you last week about our new product line. Thanks for letting me know what time works best for you. Could we set the meeting for Tuesday at 10am? Looking forward to our continued discussions. Thanks, Kyle.' This gives John a reminder of your last interaction, the context for your email, and a clear proposal for your next meeting.\"\n\nIf the input is a casual conversation or unrelated to sales emails, I'll respond conversationally. Otherwise, here's my evaluation and recommendations for your email: {input}."
